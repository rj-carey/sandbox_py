# 🐍 Python Sandbox 
**A sandbox for random classes, model, scripts, etc.**

Created and maintained by [@rj-carey](https://github.com/rj-carey)

## 🧪 About
This repository is a collection of miscellaneous Python code snippets, models, experiments, and small-scale projects. It's not meant to be production-ready code, but rather a space to try things out, learn, and iterate quickly.

## 📁 Project Structure
While the structure may evolve, here's a general layout:
- `models/` – From-scratch data structures and other custom model implementations.
- `algorithms/` – From-scratch basic algorithms.
- `utils/` – Helper functions and modules.
- `experiments/` – Small, self-contained scripts for testing.
- `requirements.txt` – List of dependencies, if any.
- `gitignore` - 
- `README.md` – You're here!

## 🚀 Getting Started
To get up and running with the sandbox environment:

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rj-carey/sandbox_py.git
cd sandbox_py
```

### 2. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended)
```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate it
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install dependencies (if applicable)
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
**Note: If requirements.txt is empty, it's likely no external dependencies are required.**

## ✅ Usage
Use this space to:
* Try out new Python features or libraries
* Prototype scripts quickly
* Store reusable code snippets
* Create structures/algorithms from scratch

## 🧹 Cleanup
To remove the virtual environment (if needed):
```bash
deactivate  # exit virtual env
rm -rf venv  # remove environment folder
```
